# Analyzing Formula 1 Data: A Statistical Dashboard

## Project Overview
In this project, we leveraged several statistical and machine learning methodologies to analyze Formula 1 race data. We aimed to gain some insights about Formula 1 racing and create a comprehensive dashboard to present our analysis.

## Data Overview
Using data sourced from [https://openf1.org/], we curated a dataset of race statistics, driver performance metrics, and team attributes in order to answer specific questions about Formula 1 racing. A detailed data dictionary is provided in the dashboard for further insight into the variables used.

## Statistical Methods
We focused our analyses on several different machine learning algorithms for regression and classification on the dataset including:

- Multiple Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- LOESS, or natural cubic spline fit
- kNN Classification
- Naive Bayes Classification
- Logistic Regression Classification

## Conclusions
Through this project, we applied various statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze Formula 1 racing data. Our analysis allowed us to gain more insight into Formula 1 racing and the field of sports analytics. By presenting our findings in an interactive dashboard, we aim to inspire further exploration into Formula 1 racing analytics.

## Collaborators
This project was a combined effort between Nandini Bhelke and Kevin Hallissey towards leveraging our skills in data processing, cleaning, and statistical analysis.

## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank our professor, Dr. Christian Lucero, for his guidance throughout this project.
